  <p>Title: Equipment and Farmer training
keywords: mask, snorkel, fins</p>
<p>As any aspiring farmer, I need to train and improve personal
equipment. In Kelp Farming, my mask, snorkel, and fins are 
critical for survival and daily operations.</p>

<p>The blue pair of fins I purchased and used in my 02018 scuba diving
trip to Maui and didn't have any complaints.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, I often went to the downtown Colorado Springs 
YMCA pool to swim laps and use my gear, including the blue fins.
From <a href="https://scubapro.johnsonoutdoors.com/us">ScubaPro</a>, I
my main mask and snorkel and a <a href="https://scubapro.johnsonoutdoors.com/us/shop/fins/rubber-fin">black pair of fins</a>
full foot design. </p>
<p>Last September my wife re-certified her scuba diving certification 
and was doing her evaluation dives in Monterey Bay. On the second day,
a Sunday, I joined her for the dives and was my first time diving into 
Kelp beds. My current neoprene booties a too large for the blue fins, so
I rented a pair along with tanks and weights from <a href="https://montereybayscuba.com/">Montery Bay Scuba</a>.</p>
<p>On the second dive, I was falling behind the group as we moved through the 
giant kelp near the pier and my left fin unbuckled and started drifting 
away. At about 9.1 meters (30 feet) I kicked over, sat down on the bottom,
first controlling my breathing, then got both of my fins on and totally 
lost the group and my dive and life partner. I ascend to the top among 
the giant kelp and got initially tangled, and then waited until the group
surfaced with the divemaster and instructor. We then continued the dive.</p>
<p>In December, Melissa and I went for a dive vacation in Cozumel and I had
the best dives of my life. Here is a photo from the last dive of the vacation:</p>
<p><img alt="Thumbs-up from Cozumel" src="thumbs-up-cozumel-02023-12.png" /></p>
<p>I used the black fins as you can see. They were adequate for the dives but
I need more kick power with a full wetsuit.</p>
